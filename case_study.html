                <h1>Case Study: SecureHome Reduces Video Analysis Costs by 45% in a Single Day</h1>
                <p>SecureHome, a provider of AI-powered home security monitoring, needed to analyze millions of motion-triggered video clips daily. Their existing infrastructure, built on powerful 4-vCPU AWS Lambda functions, was effective but expensive. By migrating to LambdaX, they cut costs by 45% and reduced processing latency from 10 seconds to under 3.5 seconds—all within a single workday.</p>

                <h2>The Original Pipeline: A High-Cost Bottleneck</h2>
                <p>SecureHome's processing pipeline was built on a 4-vCPU AWS Lambda function. For each clip, the function would:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Fetch & Download:</strong> Connect to an RDS database and S3 bucket inside their VPC.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decode & Infer:</strong> Use the 4 vCPUs to run a parallelized YOLOv8 object detection model.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This setup was powerful but inefficient for inference. The function took <span class="highlight">10 seconds</span> to run, costing them <span class="highlight">~$1,200 per million clips</span>.</p>

                <h2>10:00 AM: A 2-Hour Migration for Immediate Savings</h2>
                <p>The engineering team started their morning by testing a simple "lift-and-shift" migration.</p>
                <div class="story-box">
                    <h3>The Migration:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Container:</strong> They changed their Dockerfile's base to an NVIDIA CUDA image and updated their <code>requirements.txt</code> to use the GPU-enabled version of PyTorch.</li>
                        <li><strong>Code:</strong> They added a single line of code—<code>.to('cuda')</code>—to move their YOLOv8 model onto the GPU.</li>
                        <li><strong>Slice Selection:</strong> They analyzed their function's memory footprint and selected a <strong>2x Slice</strong> on LambdaX, which provided more than enough vCPU, RAM, and VRAM for their workload.</li>
                        <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> <strong>No changes were needed.</strong> Because LambdaX integrates with existing AWS networking and IAM, their function's code for connecting to their private VPC resources worked out-of-the-box.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Morning Results:</h3>
                <p>This simple migration, combined with the powerful resources of the 2x Slice, yielded a dramatic performance boost.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Latency:</strong> Dropped from 10 seconds to <span class="highlight">4.5 seconds</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Dropped from ~$1,200 to <span class="highlight">~$900 per million clips</span>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2:00 PM: A 4-Hour Refactor for Transformational Speed</h2>
                <p>After lunch, encouraged by the results, a developer dedicated the afternoon to a simple optimization: batching.</p>
                <div class="story-box">
                    <h3>The Refactor:</h3>
                    <p>The developer modified the function's logic. Instead of inferring on each frame individually, they:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Decoded a small batch of <strong>32 frames</strong>.</li>
                        <li>"Stacked" the frames into a single tensor.</li>
                        <li>Sent this entire batch to the GPU for inference in a single pass.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This allowed them to fully leverage the GPU's parallel processing capabilities. They continued using the same <strong>2x Slice</strong>.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Afternoon Results:</h3>
                <p>This change was transformative.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Latency:</strong> The total processing time dropped to just <span class="highlight">3.3 seconds</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> The cost plummeted to <span class="highlight">~$660 per million clips</span>—a <strong>45% reduction</strong> from their original AWS Lambda bill.</li>
